        <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
        <p>​I am a certified ACE personal trainer and continuing my education in nutrition and performance
            enhancement.

            I am married with two CRAZY boys and one behemoth sized dog. I am an animal lover is an understatement.
            I haven’t had the story book beginnings into heath and fitness.
            I was never an athlete or into fitness until much later in my life. I was the nerdy shy wallflower.
            Admittedly, I have had my own struggles. I have spent years validating myself worth through
            others approval never feeling good enough no matter what efforts I made.
            I have been broken down, isolated, and made to feel less than. I had completely lost who I was.
            I felt stuck and afraid of change, of the unknown. It wasn't until I took time out to take care of ME when
            things started to change. I slowly began finding my strength and
            self-worth through
            fitness.
            Through my own personal passage, I have found my passion in helping others.
            I love working with individuals who are ready to tap into their potential. I am a safe space for those who
            have
            lost their way and individuals who are ready for a change.
            No matter if your goal is weight loss, muscle gain, balance or more education. I’m ready to help you achieve
            some <strong> RESULTS all while keeping you motivated and having a good laugh!</strong></p>
