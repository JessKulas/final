    <h1>Meet Nicole</h1>
    <p>​I am a certified ACE personal trainer and continuing my education in nutrition and performance
        enhancement.

        I am married with two CRAZY boys and one behemoth sized dog. I am an animal lover is an understatement.
        I haven’t had the story book beginnings into heath and fitness.
        I was never an athlete or into fitness until much later in my life. I was the nerdy shy wallflower.
        Admittedly, I have had my own struggles. I have spent years validating myself worth through
        others approval never feeling good enough no matter what efforts I made.
        I have been broken down, isolated, and made to feel less than. I had completely lost who I was.
        I felt stuck and afraid of change, of the unknown. It wasn't until I took time out to take care of ME when
        things started to change. I slowly began finding my strength and
        self-worth through
        fitness.
        Through my own personal passage, I have found my passion in helping others.
        I love working with individuals who are ready to tap into their potential. I am a safe space for those who have
        lost their way and individuals who are ready for a change.
        No matter if your goal is weight loss, muscle gain, balance or more education. I’m ready to help you achieve
        some <strong> RESULTS all while keeping you motivated and having a good laugh!</strong></p>
