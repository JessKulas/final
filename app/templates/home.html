            <p>​I am a certified ACE personal trainer and continuing my education in nutrition and performance
                enhancement.

                I am married with two CRAZY boys and one behemoth sized dog. I am an animal lover is an understatement.
                I haven’t had the story book beginnings into heath and fitness.
                I was never an athlete or into fitness until much later in my life. I was the nerdy shy wallflower.
                Admittedly, I have had my own struggles. I have spent years validating myself worth through
                others approval never feeling good enough no matter what efforts I made.
                I have been broken down, isolated, and made to feel less than. I had completely lost who I was.
                I felt stuck and afraid of change, of the unknown. It wasn't until I took time out to take care of ME
                when
                things started to change. I slowly began finding my strength and
                self-worth through
                fitness.
                Through my own personal passage, I have found my passion in helping others.
                I love working with individuals who are ready to tap into their potential. I am a safe space for those
                who
                have
                lost their way and individuals who are ready for a change.
                No matter if your goal is weight loss, muscle gain, balance or more education. I’m ready to help you
                achieve
                some <strong> RESULTS all while keeping you motivated and having a good laugh!</strong></p>
